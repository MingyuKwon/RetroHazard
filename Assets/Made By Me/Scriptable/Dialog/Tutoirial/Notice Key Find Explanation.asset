  - Ah! I almost forgot to mention something.
  - The door leading to the archaeological site is locked, but I've managed to secure
    the key that opens it.
  - I've hidden it at the upper part of the beach, so all you need to do is find
    it and use it to unlock the door.
  - I've also hidden a <b>shield</b> and a <b>Energy Container</b> there, so make
    sure to take those with you.
  - "Especially the <b>Energy Container</b> - I highly recommend taking it. No matter
    how confident you are with the mission, \n\nI've never seen anyone complete it
    without a <b>Energy Container</b>"
  - 'In any case, make sure to gather everything you need so you can proceed.


    Good
    luck.'
