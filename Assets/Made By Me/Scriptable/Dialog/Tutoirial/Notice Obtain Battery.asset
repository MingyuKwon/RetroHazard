  - 'You''ve taken the Energy Container I mentioned!


    That''s the most common
    model, so it should be easy to find batteries for it.'
  - To give you a brief explanation, equipping that Energy Container will enhance
    your attack damage.
  - "However, keep in mind you can't use it indefinitely. \n\nYou can only use it
    as many times as the number of batteries you have, so if you use it thoughtlessly,
    you may find yourself in a difficult situation."
  - If you run out of batteries, you can reload energy using the energy reload button."
