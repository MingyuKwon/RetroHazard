  - Ah ah ah, can you hear me?
  - If you're near the coast now, it probably means we've successfully smuggled ourselves
    in.
  - Let's reiterate our objective once again, it is to steal the most expensive artifact
    from the "Okera" region.
  - "In the center of the \"Okera\" region lies the tomb of the \"Noshuc\" dynasty.
    \n\nOur goal is to enter there, steal the sword made of jewels belonging to the
    founding king, and successfully escape.\""
  - "\"You should be able to see the archaeological site as you go down, and you
    can enter the village through there. \n\nGood luck.\""
