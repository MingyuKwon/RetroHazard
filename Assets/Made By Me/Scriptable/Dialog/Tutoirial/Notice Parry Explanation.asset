  m_Name: Notice Parry Explanation
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  noticeDialog:
  - If you have a shield, try to parry!
  - You can only parry an attack when the enemy is not just wandering around, but
    attacking.
  - 'When you attempt to parry, one shield gauge is used up, but if you succeed in
    parrying, you can get that gauge back! '
  - However, be careful, if you fail to parry and your shield turns white, you'll
    be defenseless as your shield won't function!
