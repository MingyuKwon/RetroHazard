  - You've picked up the shield I mentioned
  - "To give you a brief explanation, when you equip that shield, \n\nyou'll be able
    to defend against enemy attacks."
  - "However, you can't use it continuously. \n\nYou can only use it as many times
    as the number of shield batteries you have, \nso if you use it thoughtlessly,
    you may find yourself in a difficult situation."
  - If you run out of batteries, you can reload the shield using the shield reload
    button.
