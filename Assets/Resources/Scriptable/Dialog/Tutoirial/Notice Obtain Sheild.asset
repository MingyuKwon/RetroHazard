  englishNoticeDialog:
  - It seems like you've found the shield I mentioned.
  - When equipped with the shield, you can parry or guard against the enemy's attack.
  - However, each block will consume one shield battery, so you can't block all attacks
  - So it would be best to distinguish between when to block and when to just run
    away without blocking.
