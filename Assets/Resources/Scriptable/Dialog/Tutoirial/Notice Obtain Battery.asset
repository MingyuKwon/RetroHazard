  - It seems you've obtained the energy I mentioned.
  - That energy can enhance your weapon when equipped, allowing you to deal greater
    damage than before.
  - However, the number of times you can enhance is limited by the number of batteries,
    so you have to use it wisely.
  - If you use it without thinking, you might end up unable to use it when you really
    need it.
