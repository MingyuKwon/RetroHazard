  - 'Hmm, I hadn''t thought that this entrance would be blocked. '
  - 'But since this is an excavation site, there should be a way to remove the rocks. '
  - 'Try going into the buildings in the ruins and see if there''s something you
    can use to blow up the rocks. '
  - ' From what I know, they were using nitroglycerin to blow up rocks here. If you
    can use that, you''ll be able to clear the rocks away.'
