  - 'Oh, this entrance is blocked with a <b>level 3</b> security measure...

    

    You''ll
    have to come back after finding a way to upgrade the level of the key.'
  - 'Getting a Level 3 key all at once is virtually impossible.

    

    I guess
    the only way is to collect<b> parts that can enhance the key and upgrade it</b>.'
  - 'You don''t have money to buy new parts, so you probably have to find a way to
    get them for free.

    

    Maybe you can get some clues by <b>asking the
    people in the village</b>?'
