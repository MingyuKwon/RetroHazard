  - 'Welcome to the Okera region!

    

    This Okera region has a long history,
    with <b>numerous nations existing before Okera</b>.

    

    According to
    what is known so far, the order of nations established was <b>Lasil -> Eogory
    -> Noshuc</b> -> Okera.'
  - 'The tomb right next door is the <b>Noshuc Royal Mausoleum</b>, which boasts
    the largest scale among the royal tombs found so far.

    

    The <b>Eogory
    Royal Mausoleum</b>, which appears when you go north, has a very <b>unique structure</b>,
    so we recommend you to take a tour.


'
  - 'Lastly, the location of the <b>Lasil Royal Mausoleum</b> has not yet been found...

    

    However,
    the <b>Lasil archaeological site has recently been discovered</b>, and we think
    that its location can be found as the excavation progresses.

    

    If
    the Lasil Royal Mausoleum is actually found, please come back for another tour!
