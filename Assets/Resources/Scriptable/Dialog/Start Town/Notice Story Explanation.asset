  - 'Oh, you''ve arrived safely.

    

    I need to keep the line open for communications
    with other agents, so I won''t be able to stay on the line with you. '
  - Lastly, let me fill you in on the <b>current situation in this country</b>, which
    might be useful for your mission.
  - "This country has <b>a long history</b> and used to thrive on tourism related
    to historical sites. \n\n"
  - 'However, a few years ago, <b>monsters suddenly began to appear</b>, and the
    <b>security situation has deteriorated significantly</b>.


'
  - <b>Many people with money fled to the relatively safer Jujedo Island</b>, leaving
    many cities abandoned.
  - Moreover, <b>most of the roads have been closed for safety reasons against monsters</b>,
    which restricts free movement.
  - 'Of course, it''s not that <b>you can''t use the roads</b>. If you have <b>a
    key issued by the country</b>, you can open the roads, but the<b> problem is
    that these keys are ridiculously expensive</b>. '
  - Furthermore, there are different security levels for each road, so even if you
    have a key, you can't open all the roads.
  - I'll be away for a while. Please carry on with the mission in the meantime.
