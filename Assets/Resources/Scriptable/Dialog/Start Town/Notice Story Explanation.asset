  - 'Oh, you''ve arrived safely.

    

    I need to keep the line open for communications
    with other agents, so I won''t be able to stay on the line with you. But, I''ll
    check in occasionally.'
  - Lastly, let me fill you in on the current situation in this country, which might
    be useful for your mission.
  - "This country has a long history and used to thrive on tourism related to historical
    sites. \n\nHowever, a few years ago, monsters suddenly began to appear, and the
    security situation has deteriorated significantly."
  - "Many people with money fled to the relatively safer Jujedo Island, leaving many
    cities abandoned.\n\n Moreover, most of the roads have been closed for safety
    reasons against monsters, which restricts free movement."
  - "Of course, it's not that you can't use the roads. If you have a key issued by
    the country, you can open the roads, but the problem is that these keys are ridiculously
    expensive. \n\nFurthermore, there are different security levels for each road,
    so even if you have a key, you can't open all the roads."
  - "Anyway, they give out level 0 keys for free to foreigners, so it would be a
    good idea to get one first and think about upgrading it. \n\nThe more places
    you can go, the easier it will be to achieve your objectives."
