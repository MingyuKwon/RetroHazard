  - Oh right, I didn't explain the locking system of this country yet.
  - Because so many monsters started to appear, the government closed off almost
    all the paths.
  - And only people with <b>designated key</b>s can come and go.
  - Keys range from <b>Level 0 to Level 3</b>, and the <b>higher the level, the higher
    the lock you can open</b> and go to a new area.
  - Just note that the higher the level of the key, the more astronomically expensive
    it is.
  - So, the more money you have, the safer you can live in areas with high security
    levels, and if you don't have money, you keep living in dangerous places without
    being able to go anywhere.
